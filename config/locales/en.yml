      Hooray %{user_name}, 

      You are ready to start reasoning with essence, reaching conclusions faster, and taking decisions. No more empty debates or not being sure why you do something.
       
      You can create private (for you or for a small group) or public Clubs. Clubs are where the action is: start compiling lists of pros and cons, and document them. 

      If you use this in your company, tell us, and pay us! If you use this as an individual, share with your friends so people in companies get to know it and end up paying us so you can keep using it for free!

      Now, go to your account: %{user_url}

      or explore public Clubs: http://Reasons.club

      Best, 

      Álvaro Ortiz
      Chief Reasoner
