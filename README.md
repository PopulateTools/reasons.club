### For small teams

* Let people add their reasons to a debate, or only vote for existing reasons
* Gather feedback from many people about complex isuses with order and structure

## About 

Why do we hold the views we hold? Are we critic enough with the opinions we have? How do we get to form our opinions? Reasons.club aims to be a place that helps people to be more conscious about why they think what they think, and to help anyone better understand issues by outlining pros and cons and documenting them with external references to have informed opinions about those issues.

## General roadmap

* Let people gather together to outline reasons about isssues (public and group discussions)
* Let individuals create private clubs to organize their knowledge and help them decide things with order
* Create public profiles about what people think and why, and to have arguments (pros and cons) around issues in the public sphere

## Specific roadmap
